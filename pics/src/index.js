//These lines import the necessary modules for React application development. React is imported from the react library, while ReactDOM (specifically the createRoot method) is imported from the react-dom/client module.
// The App component is imported from the App.js file.

const el = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(el);
//This code defines a constant el that represents the root element of the React application. The root element is typically an HTML element with an id attribute of 'root'. 
//The document.getElementById('root') method is used to retrieve this element from the HTML document.

//The ReactDOM.createRoot(el) method is then called, passing the root element el as an argument. This creates a root instance for React rendering and associates it with the provided root element.

root.render(<App/>);
//This line initiates the rendering of the React application. The root.render() method is called with the <App /> component as its argument. 
//This instructs React to render the App component and its child components into the root element specified earlier.

//The JSX syntax <App /> is a shorthand for creating an instance of the App component. It will be rendered as a tree of React components, starting from the App component as the root.

//Overall, this code sets up the React application, defines the root element, creates a root instance using createRoot, and renders the App component into the root elemen
